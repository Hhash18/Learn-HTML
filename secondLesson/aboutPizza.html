            <h2>What is Pizza?</h2>
            <p>
                Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
                (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.) which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

            <h2>History of Pizza</h2>
            <p>
                The history of pizza is a long and complex one, with roots that can be traced back to ancient civilizations. The modern pizza as we know it today originated in Naples, Italy in the
                18th or early 19th century. It was originally a simple dish made with flatbread, tomatoes, and cheese, and was popular among the working class. Over time, pizza evolved and became more
                elaborate, with a wide variety of toppings and styles emerging.
