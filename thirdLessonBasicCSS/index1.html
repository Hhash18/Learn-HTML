            <p id="first">
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and design web pages. It controls the appearance of HTML elements such as colors, fonts, margins, and layouts. With CSS,
                developers can create visually attractive and well-structured websites. It also allows consistent styling across multiple pages. This makes web design more efficient and professional.

            <p id="second">
                CSS helps separate the content from the design of a website. <span>HTML</span> is used to create the structure, while <span class="highlight">CSS</span> is used to handle the
                presentation. This separation makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain. CSS also reduces repetition because one style can be applied to multiple elements. As a result, websites
                load faster and are easier to update.

            <h2>Article 3 - Responsive Design with CSS</h2>
            <p id="third" class="gray">
                CSS plays an important role in creating responsive websites. Using features like media queries, developers can adjust layouts for different screen sizes. This ensures that websites
                work properly on mobiles, tablets, and desktops. Responsive design improves user experience and accessibility. Therefore, CSS is essential in modern web development.
